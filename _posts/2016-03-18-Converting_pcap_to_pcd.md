Start with setting up ROS environment

```
source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash
```

Bad News: ROS [velodyne stack](http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20HDL-32E "ROS") is only supported in indigo and not yet in jade (likely this will change) <br>
I'm gonna try compiling the indigo stack on jade and see what happens.
