title: Fix Shadows

When the openni_grabber demo is run with any VLP-16 data set, there appear 2 more copies of all the points below the first set of points. 
The points are not vertical translations but appear to be angular translations from the LiDAR origin.
It seems that the openni_grabber demo is designed for HDL-32 data sets (as described on -insert link- page by PCL)
I ran some HDL-32 sample data sets and confirmed no occurence of these shadows.
All the data sets I've collected with the Velodyne VLP-16 have these shadows as do the sample data sets Leo has left behind.

Next Step: Find VLP-16 Calibration File
