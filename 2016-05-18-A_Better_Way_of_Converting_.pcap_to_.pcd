title: A Better Way of Converting .pcap to .pcd
---

I made a program using PCL tools and compiled it as wasif_vlp_viewer.
This effectively allows the user to feed in a .pcap file, type in the name of an output directory, and choose the time in between each .pcd frame [minimum of 0.1 seconds].
The output directory will be automatically created and all the .pcd frames saved into that directory.

It is best not to interact with the 3D viewer while the program runs to avoid pausing the program and disrupting the framerate.

Checkout Echidna for wasif_vlp_viewer.cpp
I won't upload the contents of the file--to avoid a clever yet unethical master student from snagging away my hard work ;)
